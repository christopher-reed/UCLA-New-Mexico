# About The Project
The Greater Chaco Region of Northwest New Mexico, loosely defined as an 8,000 mi<sup>2</sup> area around Chaco Canyon National Historical Park in the northwest corner of New Mexico, has been home to the rich cultures of many Indigenous Nations for thousands of years. The area, recognized as a World Heritage Site, is currently home to twenty indigenous nations, including the Navajo, Hopi of Arizona, and modern-day Pueblo tribes. Unfortunately, oil and gas extraction in this region poses a significant threat to current Indigenous communities, which are disproportionately affected by their associated environmental harms. Oil and gas drilling and production releases toxic air pollutants including volatile organic compounds (VOCs) like benzene, toluene and ethyl benzene, which can result in health impacts including respiratory diseases and cancer. VOCs, as well as nitrogen oxides (NOx) released by oil and gas activity, can react with sunlight to form ground level ozone, which can reduce pulmonary function and aggravate conditions like asthma and emphysema, in some cases increasing risk of premature death. In addition to health problems, the drilling also poses significant threats to historic and cultural resources.

These impacts may be exacerbated by potential lack of compliance with state and federal clean air laws by the oil and gas industry. However, determining compliance by well operators and other entities is difficult due to a lack of available data and a complex regulatory structure in the state; oil and gas activity in New Mexico is regulated by two separate agencies that track their own data, using their own systems, terminology, and tracking systems, making it difficult to adequately assess compliance with permitting processes and allowing potential violations to slip through the cracks.

Our team is collaborating with WildEarth Guardians, an environmental non-profit organization dedicated to dedicated to protecting and restoring the wildlife, wild places, wild rivers, and health of the American West, to accomplish two goals. The first is to determine if oil and gas operations are violating pollution regulations, including by operating before they have received required permits under the federal Clean Air Act that are designed to reduce pollution impacts. The second is to determine the extent to which tribal communities are being unduly affected by oil and gas operations in the region.
